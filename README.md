### Project Objective 

AnyCompany Manufacturing is looking to become a world class manufacturing company. To achieve this all machines within the factory should operate at a 85% or higher Overall Operating Efficiency to be considered world class. AnyCompany manufacturing has found that they are are close to this operating target but suspect there are operators of the machine that need improvement.

You as Analyst need to investigate this and work backwards to solve the problem of having a low operational effectiveness efficiency. You will ultimately build a real-time data pipeline resulting in machine insights and visualizations for factory effectiveness.
